/* Using an ESP8266 to constuct an anemometer using a low cost anemometer head unit. It measures the time of one rotation, from
   which it determins wind speed. The actual reading is determined empirically and adjusted for aerodynamic drag effects. The
   values displayed by the unit match those of a Davis Instruments 6152 Weather Station.
